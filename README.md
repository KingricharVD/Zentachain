##### The problem worth solving

*Need for secure interaction and digital data storage - owned by the initiators.*
*A. Resolve the thread of unauthorized data access and manipulation of information streams.*
*B. Protect against hackers - getting unauthorized access and stealing information, logging, harvesting and selling your data.*
*C. Leverage net neutrality*
*D. Ensure ownership of data and data security*
*E. Provide a secure framework for the hosting and creation of dApps*
*F. Ownership and security of cloud storage*
*G. Unencrypted, unsafe data storage Every transaction made on your device of issued by your*
*action on some digital medium is potentially logged and stored somewhere in a database or on a*
*file server. It is very likely that this data isn’t properly encrypted or anonymized.*


##### Vision

*Zentachain envisions a decentral ecosystem build for net neutral data- and transactions*
*interchange and data storage. The ecosystem is maintained by its users and immune against*
*several forms of cyber attacks and hacking. Next to that, viable solutions for security and data*
*ownership problems are present. The Zentachain is open source. Zentachain aims to become the*
*missing gap between decentralized meshnet cloud services such as IPFS (https://ipfs.io) and*
*dynamic routing and addressing protocols such as DNS and HTTPS. This comes down to the*
*fact that Zenta Labs will upgrade the IPFS peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol with state-of-the*
*art blockchain technology.*

*The web will not only become ultra secure and decentralized and made permanent, it will also*
*become faster and more open. Zentachain will enable the ability to address large amounts of data*
*with IPFS, and place the immutable, permanent IPFS links onto the Zenta ledger by using a*
*blockchain transaction. This timestamps and secures content, without having to put the data on*
*the Zentachain itself. Next to that, Zentachain will add additional encryption to files stored on the*
*meshnet. Zentachain brings the freedom and independent spirit of the web at full force and at low*
*cost. The ecosystem will help deliver content in a way which can save you considerable money.*
*High latency networks are a real barrier of entry to developing world, the Zentachain provides*
*resilient access to data, independent of low latency or connectivity to the backbone. Zentachain*
wants to be truly decentralized, without any exception and will design the ecosystem in such a way* 
that keeps track of its users and will never save IP-address or any personal information. By design* 
the ecosystem simply doesn’t have this information nor can link transactions to a certain user or identity.*



##### What makes Zentachain awesome?


------------

##### Zentalk

*Zentalk is a highly secure hybrid encryption decentralized peer-to-peer messenger. Next to great usability, under the hood, you’ll find* *state-of-the-art encryption with AES-256, Diffie-Helman, RSA and El-Gamal security and since it’s decentralized, without having a* *server-point Zentachain guarantees full anonymity and offline communication between sender and receiver using the Blake2b hashing* *function and the Tor-network.* 

##### Zentalk & Zentamesh-network

*A Mesh Network is also known as MeshNet and is an alternative to the internet without any centralized authority.*
*Every participant in the MeshNet represents an independent Node that functions as a fully active access point to the network making it* *the most reliable form of a network available.*
*Whenever a node leaves the network the remaining nodes can easily redistribute the dataflow to the best available connection.*

*The MeshNet functions wirelessly and allows computers and devices to interact without a cable modem. The devices themselves create a* *largely distributed network which can potentially cover the whole globe.*
*Users in the MeshNet can anonymously send and receive encrypted data securely by swapping encryption keys with Blake2 Algorithm*
*making the data inaccessible to any third party.*

*In the future this network of distributed node-miniservers could stay available even if the regular internet collapsed.*
*Unlike the regular internet the MeshNet is also immune to censorship. Not only because it is a completely decentralized network, also* *due to its uniquely intelligent distribution and healing properties. A node that is taken offline will automatically be compensated by* *redistributing the traffic in the best way possible to the existing nodes around it.*
*That way information will continue to travel through the network at the best rate possible without interruption.*
*There is a point which one is the problem today it is the range and the gateways*

*In the last couple of years mesh networking functions have been integrated more and more into everyday applications. Especially in* *consumer electronics routers, WLAN repeaters and powerline adapters started implementing the technology.*
*For instance, the well-known German internet solution FritzBox is using MeshNet components with information that has a very low range.*

*The vision of Zentalk is to utilize this very technology to bring worldwide secure 24/7 live communication and data exchange to the* *masses. Without a central authority, communication can run in between the active network Zentanodes, increasing the coverage of network with every joining user. As long as there are at least two active users in the Zentamesh-Network, communication can occur without the need for an* *internet or telephone service provider.*

*The Zentameshnet has self healing properties that contribute to the ability to achieve censorship*
*resistance. Self-healing means if a Zentanode connection is blocked or disabled, the Zentamesh-network*
can patch and reroute around the lost Zentanodes. The data is redirected and the network is still functional.*
*Zentamesh-network can be applied to both wired and wireless networks, as well as the Zentalk will*
*establish the Zentameshed WLAN (Wireless Local Access Network). This MWLAN is achieved through*
*the use of a Zentanodes Meshed WiFi. This will be required for offline communication using Zentalk.*

##### Zentalk & Hyperboria

*Zentachain looks to address issues of privacy and online security through a decentralized*
*alternative to the Internet called Hyperboria. Hyperboria is a Mesh Network which utilizes the*
*cjdns protocol to ensure complete end-to-end encryption. This is achieved by using public-key*
*cryptography for address allocation and a distributed hash table for routing. Communication*
*between two nodes can only be established after the connection has been verified, eliminating*
*the possibility of third party intrusion or eavesdropping. Routing is executed using a system*
*similar to Kademlia DHT enabling the network to maintain an optimal load across all nodes.*
*Zentachain believes in the Open Internet. By employing Hyperboria we give our users the*
*opportunity to transmit their data in a fast, secure and private way, without having to fear*
*unwanted intrusion from malicious entities or centralized service providers.*

##### Zentavault

*Zentavault is a high-throughput encrypted and distributed file vault (encrypted storage) and*
*transfer service. Unlike regular data storage systems, Zentavault will store nothing on users’* 
devices. Zentavault acts as an encryption delivery vehicle, with the ability to encrypt and*
*dynamically distribute content securely onto the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). IPFS is a*
*peer-to-peer distributed file system that seeks to connect all computing devices with the same*
*system of files. In some ways, IPFS is similar to the World Wide Web, but IPFS could be seen*
*as a single BitTorrent swarm, exchanging objects within one Git repository.*

##### Zentagate a gateway to IPFS (Zentavault)

*„IPFS-DNS and HTTP-Gateway will be 2 tasks for ZentaGate“*
*At Zentachain we take security and anonymity very serious. We designed Zentachain in such a way*
that it is running on its own private Mesh network. Zentagate connects the ecosystem*
*to unsafe networks such as the Internet. Zentagate provides additional encryption and anti-hack layer,*
to ensure user data and transactions are guaranteed safe. Next to gatekeeping*
*and safe-unsafe network relaying we plan on implementing a decentralized name service as*
*well. Zentagate will run this service - enabling routing and rerouting data and transactions in*
*and out the Zentachain*

##### The ZentaDex Exchanger

*Zentadex is a decentralized exchange (DEX) is a cryptocurrency exchange which operates in a decentralized way, i.e., without a central* *authority or it is an exchange market that does not rely on a third-party service to hold the customer's funds. Decentralized* *exchanges* *allow peer-to-peer trading of cryptocurrencies.*

*The most obvious benefit to using a decentralized exchange over a centralized one is their "trustless" nature. You are not required to* *trust the security or honesty of the exchange since the funds are held by you in your personal wallet and not by a third party.*

*Another advantage of the decentralized model is the privacy it provides. Users are not required to disclose their personal details to* *anyone, except if the exchange method involves bank transfers, in which case your identity is revealed only to the person that is* *selling or buying from you.*
