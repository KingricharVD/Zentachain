#### Overview

*Zentachain is a blockchain-based Platform that enables you to store your files and chat with users around the world, both with a level of security and privacy that has never been available to the public before. Software creators can use Zentachain to host decentralized apps and make them available to the world, more reliable and quicker than ever. By utilizing ground-breaking technologies like the Blockchain, smart-contracts and dpos, new highly secure forms of communication and data-transaction are made possible. ZentaChain is combining these and other technologies to bring you a platform that’s ready for a future beyond the age of information.*

#### 1.0 The problem worth solving

*Need for secure interaction and digital data storage - owned by the initiators.
*A. Resolve the thread of unauthorized data access and manipulation of information streams.
*B. Protect against hackers - getting unauthorized access and stealing information, logging,harvesting and selling your data.
*C. Leverage net neutrality
*D. Ensure ownership of data and data security
*E. Provide a secure framework for the hosting and creation of dApps
*F. Ownership and security of cloud storage
*G. Unencrypted, unsafe data storage Every transaction made on your device of issued by your
*action on some digital medium is potentially logged and stored somewhere in a database or on a
*file server. It is very likely this at this data isn’t properly encrypted or anonymized.

#### 2.0 Vision

*Zentachain envisions a decentral ecosystem build for net neutral data- and transactions
interchange and data storage. The ecosystem is maintained by its users and immune against
several forms of cyber attacks and hacking. Next to that, viable solutions for security and data
ownership problems are present. The Zentachain is open source. Zentachain aims to become the
missing gap between decentralized meshnet cloud services such as IPFS (https://ipfs.io) and
dynamic routing and addressing protocols such as DNS and HTTPS. This comes down to the
fact that Zenta Labs will upgrade the IPFS peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol with state-of-the
art blockchain technology.

*The web will not only become ultra secure and decentralized and made permanent, it will also
become faster and more open. Zentachain will enable the ability to address large amounts of data
with IPFS, and place the immutable, permanent IPFS links onto the Zenta ledger by using a
blockchain transaction. This timestamps and secures content, without having to put the data on
the ZentaChain itself. Next to that, Zentachain will add additional encryption to files stored on the
meshnet. Zentachain brings the freedom and independent spirit of the web at full force and at low
cost. The ecosystem will help deliver content in a way which can save you considerable money.
High latency networks are a real barrier of entry to developing world, the Zentachain provides
resilient access to data, independent of low latency or connectivity to the backbone. Zentachain
wants to be truly decentral, without any exception and will design the ecosystem in such a
way that it never keep track on its users and will never save IP-address or any personal
information. By design the ecosystem simply doesn’t have this information nor can link
transactions to a certain user or identity.

#### 3.0 What makes ZentaChain awesome?

*ZentDapp: Designed for decentralized privacy services
*Zenta enables users to build and host dApps within the ecosystem. All the running dApps will
*be anonymous and secure by design, no record of users and linked transactions will be stored
*within the platform. To prove and demonstrate the capabilities of ZentaChain, the team
*introduces a decentralized ultra secure messenger

##### Zentalk

*Zentalk is a secured, decentralized peer-to-peer messenger App. Next to great usability,
*under the hood you’ll find state-of-the-art encryption, security and since it’s decental,
*Zentachain guaranties full anonymity. All communication sent and received through Zentalk
*will be tunneled, pushed and dragged through a Zentamesh, a high performing MeshNet.This
*gives Zentalk the unique advantage that it’s virtually immune against any forms of hack- or
*modification events like censorship and eavesdropping attempts.*

##### Zentalk & Meshnet

*A Mesh Network, also known as MeshNet, is an alternative to the internet without any centralized authority. 
*Every participant in the MeshNet represents an independent Node that functions as a fully active access point to the network making it *the most reliable form of a network available. 
*Whenever a node leaves the network the remaining nodes can easily redistribute the dataflow to the best available connection.

*The MeshNet functions wirelessly and allows computers and devices to interact without a cable modem. The devices themselves create a largely distributed network which can potentially cover the whole globe. 
Users in the MeshNet can anonymously send and receive encrypted data securely by swapping encryption keys,
making the data inaccessible to any third party.*

*In the future this network of distributed node-miniservers could stay available even if the regular internet collapsed.
*All data potentially stored on a blockchain would remain online as long as there are active nodes in the network.

*Unlike the regular internet the MeshNet is also immune to censorship. Not only because it is a completely decentralized network, also due to its uniquely intelligent distribution and healing properties. A node that is taken offline will automatically be compensated by redistributing the traffic in the best way possible to the existing nodes around it. 
That way information will continue to travel through the network at the best rate possible without interruption.*

*In the last couple of years mesh networking functions have been integrated more and more into everyday applications. Especially in consumer electronics routers, WLAN repeaters and powerline adapters started implementing the technology. 
For instance, the well-known German internet solution FritzBox is using MeshNet components with information that can be shown on a graphic display.*

*The vision of Zentalk is to utilize this very technology to bring worldwide, secure 24/7 live communication and data exchange to the masses. Without a central authority communication can run in between the active network nodes, increasing the networks coverage with every joining user. As long as there are at least two active users in the MeshNet, communication can occur without the need for an internet or telephone service provider.*

#### 4.0 The ZentaDex Exchanger

*Zentadex is a decentralized exchange (DEX) is a cryptocurrency exchange which operates in a decentralized way, i.e., without a central authority or it is an exchange market that does not rely on a third-party service to hold the customer's funds. Decentralized exchanges allow peer-to-peer trading of cryptocurrencies.*

*The most obvious benefit to using a decentralized exchange over a centralized one is their "trustless" nature. You are not required to trust the security or honesty of the exchange since the funds are held by you in your personal wallet and not by a third party.*

*Another advantage to the decentralized model is the privacy it provides. Users are not required to disclose their personal details to anyone, except if the exchange method involves bank transfers, in which case your identity is revealed only to the person that is selling or buying from you.*

#### 5.0 Zentavault

*Zentavault is a high-throughput encrypted and distributed file vault (encrypted storage) and
transfer service. Unlike regular data storage systemsk, Zentavault will store nothing on the
users device. Zentavault acts as an encryption delivery vehicle, with the ability to encrypt and
dynamically distribute content securely onto the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). IPFS is a
peer-to-peer distributed file system that seeks to connect all computing devices with the same
system of files. In some ways, IPFS is similar to the World Wide Web, but IPFS could be seen
as a single BitTorrent swarm, exchanging objects within one Git repository.*

##### Zentagate

*„IPFS-DNS and HTTP-Gateway will be 2 tasks for ZentaGate“ 
At Zentachain we take security and anonymity very serious. We designed Zentachain in such
a way that it is running on it’s own private Mesh network. Zentagate connects the ecosystem
to unsafe networks such as the Internet. Zentagate provides an additional encryption and antihack layer, to ensure userdata and transactions are guaranteed - safe. Next to gatekeeping
and safe-unsafe network relaying we plan on implementing a decentralized name service as
well. Zentagate will run this service - enabling routing and rerouting data and transactions in*
and out the Zentachain
