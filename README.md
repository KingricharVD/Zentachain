The vision of  Zentachain is largely based and focused on communication, Zentachain uses extreme encryption of data and communication the multiple encryptions are applied. Zentalk will not only be a communication application as you know it from today. Zentachain aims at it and knows that the time has come to communicate in a strong range offline to offline. Zentachain is exactly the opposite of today's communications and applications while you pay for free applications with your data and information is Zentachain is exactly the opposite of part zentachain pays the user with their own blockchain Zenta who is supports the network. 

##### What makes Zentachain awesome?

Zentachain enables users to communicate and store data with Zentalk & Zentavault within the ecosystem. All the running decentralized Apps will be anonymous and secure there will be no record of users or linked transactions to prove and demonstrate the capabilities of Zentachain, the team introduces a decentralized ultra-secure messenger.

##### Zentalk

Zentalk is a highly secure hybrid encryption decentralized peer-to-peer messenger. Next to great usability, under the hood, youâ€™ll find state-of-the-art encryption with AES-256, Diffie-Helman, RSA and El-Gamal security. Zentalk is decentralized, without having a server-point Zentachain guarantees full anonymity and offline communication between the sender and receiver using Zentanodes inclusive the hashing function Blake2 and the Tor-network. 

##### Zentalk & Hyperboria

*Zentachain looks to address issues of privacy and online security through a decentralized*
*alternative to the Internet called Hyperboria. Hyperboria is a Mesh Network which utilizes the*
*cjdns protocol to ensure complete end-to-end encryption. This is achieved by using public-key*
*cryptography for address allocation and a distributed hash table for routing. Communication*
*between two nodes can only be established after the connection has been verified, eliminating*
*the possibility of third party intrusion or eavesdropping. Routing is executed using a system*
*similar to Kademlia DHT enabling the network to maintain an optimal load across all nodes.*
*Zentachain believes in the Open Internet. By employing Hyperboria we give our users the*
*opportunity to transmit their data in a fast, secure and private way, without having to fear*
*unwanted intrusion from malicious entities or centralized service providers.*
